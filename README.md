# RedMonk
Red Monk is a general Android assistant application for diabetics. :rose:

The application allows to store and periodically change user physical stats, keep track of their medication schedule, calorie consumption, maintain a list of medical contacts and setup emergency buttons (as widgets) to quicky contact them.
